# Fan

Fan is a to do list app built with Electron. 

Press enter to add tasks. Start an entry with "#" to add as a section. Double click tasks to mark as completed. Drag tasks or sections out of the window to delete them. Color-tag tasks by ending an entry with "+r" for red, "+o" for orange, etc. Works for anything from "roy" to "g" to "biv." You can also use "+1" for red, "+2" for orange, "+7" for violet, etc.
